Module Description:
 With temperatures increasing due to climate change and the impact on the environment, building services engineers have a major role to play in the design of buildings. Buildings that are occupied must be ventilated but in a way that is environmentally friendly. The buildings should not overheat, and the occupants should have a level of comfort that promotes a happy work environment. Students will be introduced to principles of design for air conditioning and ventilation that are present in buildings and will look at future sustainable low energy innovations. In this unit the following subjects will be covered, pre-design briefs, design data, cooling loads, overheating, peak summertime temperatures, commissioning and handover procedures, soft landings, post-occupancy surveys. Successful completion of this unit will allow students to understand the general principles of air conditioning and ventilation systems for buildings.

Assessment Notes:
 The assessment is led by a real-world problem. Students are presented with a real-world problem at the start of the module that can be solved using electronic design. Throughout the module, they are guided through the process that leads to a design, completing a logbook as they proceed through the module, and at the end of the module demonstrating a piece of hardware that they have designed. The use of logbook allows formative feedback to be given on a regular basis, rather than having to wait for a submission point to get the feedback after the event. The continuous formative assessment throughout the delivery tests the student’s understanding and application to the solution of problems in electronic circuit design and analysis and also enables the student to appreciate the field of electronic circuit design through hands-on experience. When delivered in block mode for degree apprenticeships, part or all of the problem may be one that is provided by the apprentice’s employer. As such, the student may undertake part or all of the practical component within industry – and if appropriate – outside of the block reserved for the formal delivery. However this does not preclude the student from undertaking a project based at DMU if desired or appropriate.

Reassessment:
Reassessment is by Failed Component, Submission of circuit design and demonstration can be done remotely.

Expected Methods of Delivery:

Assessment Notes:
This teaching time allocated to the module is evenly divided between high level programming languages and computer aided engineering.  As a result, the summative assessment consists of two components with equal weight towards the final mark i.e. Programming Coursework (50%) and CAD Project (50%). These assignments are both practical and theoretical in nature and are designed to reflect the student's ability to solve simple engineering problems using computers.  The assignments will test a student's understanding of the background principles, while providing the students with vital feedback to enhance understanding.

contribute towards the overall assessment. The logbook and engineering drawings are individual components, the others are group led. These will demonstrate the approaches used by the student, issues of group interaction, problem solving and basic project management. The group mark will be individualised by introducing an element reflecting personal learning/contribution weighted at minimum 20% of the assignment mark. Details will be explained to students in the coursework brief. ‘Groups will identify individual contribution and therefore their marks will reflect individual contribution accordingly. A dedicated sheet to reflect these will be included in the assignment brief for group members to identify their names, their contribution in terms of % to the group work and to be signed by each member.’ This sheet needs to be submitted with the completed assignment. Students are given the opportunity to meet the teaching team regularly in case of any concerns. The nature of this module allows continuous feedback to be provided to the students, this will be through individual design review and regular presentations made by the students.

The use of logbook allows formative with a real-world problem at the start of the module that can be solved The assessment is led by a real-world problem. Students are presented the process that leads to a design, completing a logbook as they proceed using electronic design. Throughout the module, they are guided through feedback to be given on a regular basis, rather than having to wait for a submission point to get the feedback after the event. The continuous formative assessment throughout the delivery tests the student’s understanding and application to the solution of problems in electronic circuit design and analysis and also enables the student to appreciate the field of electronic circuit design through hands-on experience. When delivered in block mode for degree apprenticeships, part or all of the problem may be one that is provided by the apprentice’s employer. As such, the student may undertake part or all of the practical component within industry – and if appropriate – outside of the block reserved for the formal delivery. However this does not preclude the student from undertaking a project based at DMU if desired or appropriate.

Module Description:
•	Subsystems •	Power supply and power conversion circuits •	Filter circuits •	Oscillators •	Special ICs •	Measurement techniques •	Transducers and sensors •	Data conversions (D/A -A/D) The module combines complex theoretical aspects, analysed by solved examples during tutorials, with practical skills to be achieved by an individual project, assessed by  a logbook or blog, and a hardware demonstration. Students are encouraged to take responsibility for their project and to work in their own time as well as during the timetabled classes.    The Applied Electronics module provides an insight into some practical applications of electronics. It introduces basic functional blocks such as power supplies, amplifiers, oscillators, data acquisition circuits etc. and will also provide methods to analyse complex electronic systems to studying electronic and electrical engineering that is complementary placed on systems analysis and the module therefore provides an approach by decomposing these into constituent parts. In doing this, emphasis is to the design led modules. Practical examples will be presented in order to develop analysis skills. These examples may come from the instrumentation, communication, power electronics or biomedical fields. Students will then be able to apply these skills to case studies in order to be able to analyse a given system in order to relate a given function back to the fundamental principles and laws governing the subject. The module will use different methods to teach applied aspects of electronics including tutor led studies (lectures and tutorials) and student led studies (tutorials/seminars and project lab). The material will cover: •	Devices •	The role of electronic components and circuits in complex practical systems including the interfacing of microcontrollers with analogue signals •	Review of electronic components •	Transistor circuits and applications (analogue and digital) •	Operational amplifiers and applications

Without knowledge of electromagnetics, devices ranging from integrated circuits to electric motors to antennas cannot be properly understood and efficiently designed. This module develops an understanding of theory, numerical modelling and experimental practices relevant to this most central of electronics disciplines. The theoretical aspects of the course are generally necessarily mathematical. However, the delivery of the material develops the mathematics simply as a 'short-hand' way of describing physical phenomena. Outline content: Block 1. Vector mathematics Block 2.

Assessment Notes:
 The unseen phase test tests the students understanding of the wider concepts and principles in electromagnetics. The coursework re-enforces the principles learned in the lectures and extends the material. These summative assessments are supported by formative exercises, including tests and diagnostic tutorials as well as coursework related seminars placed strategically in the timetabled delivery of the module to inform the student of progress and performance. The laboratory report is a technical paper with a prescribed format (typically based on the requirements for IEEE publication) of five A4 pages maximum (~1500-2000 words). This report is based on the laboratory activities undertaken throughout the year.

Expected Methods of Delivery:
Principles and concepts are presented and assimilated via a structured programme of lectures and self-directed study. Practice example are provided, which are supported by tutorial session, to enable the student to reinforce the understanding of concepts and principles and gain skills and experience of their application to the solution of problems in electromagnetics. Numerical modelling is introduced and students have the opportunity to investigate the operation of one or more commercial packages. Formative non-contributory tests are used where appropriate to prove the student with feedback of the understanding and application of principles and concepts. Practical and measurement skills together with the ability to critically appraise experimental data via cogent written argument are developed via practical laboratory exercises.

Assessment Notes:
The student normally performs two marked laboratory exercises in a semester. The production of concise short-form laboratory reports is an effective method of assessing practical and measurement skills together with the ability to critically appraise experimental data via cogent written argument. The laboratory exercises are distributed strategically through the module delivery.  Each laboratory report is normally marked before the student attempts the next exercise. Although the marking of the reports contributes to the summative assessment of the module the tutor's feedback comments provide a valuable formative assessment of the student's performance and progress. The practice exercises, undertaken by the student for each topic in the semester. problems and will also motivate students to work continuously during the will help students to develop skills in solving practical engineering above over all assessment components. The case study and lab reports To pass the module the student must obtain an aggregate grade of 40% or    indicative content with tutorial support, form an important component of the formative assessment of the module.

Particular subjects developed during the tutorial and laboratory programme include numerical modelling and experimental methods.     Electromagnetics is one of the fundamental topics uniting the sub-disciplines of electronics.  Without a knowledge of electromagnetics, devices ranging from integrated circuits to electric motors to antennas can not be properly understood and efficiently designed. This module develops an understanding of theory, numerical modelling and experimental practices relevant to this most central of electronics disciplines.

Excellent written and oral presentation. 40%

Reassessment:
 Reassessment/deferral is by reworking the project or doing a new project. Reworking the project: If a student has done the technical work at a level appropriate to pass the module but he/she has not presented the work adequately then he/she can resubmit the reworked project report. Allocation of a new project: If a student has done minimal work (or no work at all) then after discussing with the student it will be explored if a new project will be more appropriate for the student. This could be due to lack of competency in key technical skills required to complete the project. Normally this will be very rare as supervisor will be able to identify these issues early on during term-time one-to-one project meetings.

Expected Methods of Delivery:

VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language), a hardware description language largely used for PLD and IC design is introduced and discussed using practical design examples. The module is assessed by an end examination together with a coursework component typically consisting of two laboratory assignments. The module builds on the knowledge from previous modules concerned with electronic principles and digital electronics. Advanced Digital Design provides a review of the design philosophy in the light of using modern Electronic Computer Aided Design (ECAD) tools for design, simulation and implementation. Programmable Logic Devices (PLD) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are discussed. Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC), microcontroller and DSP architectures / design routes are also presented.

Module Description:
  the range of stakeholders' interests involved and the ecological, social and economic dimensions of achieving sustainable solutions. Through self­ appraisal and reflective analysis linked to the project, students will better understand the ways of thinking, acting and collaborating that enable team working and project management skills in a concentrated bloc of activity. The project is an innovative task which will provide students with an effective action for sustainable development. The project is supported by workshops. In these workshops, students will work with the module team to draft the project proposal, receive feedback on the project proposal, and implement the project. Students will also be supported in the production of a reflective assignment in which they construct and comment on personal SWOT analyses, and critically evaluate how their experience has helped them meet the module's intended learning outcomes. opportunity to link theory and practice in a way which has a demonstrable impact within DMU's wider community, either in Leicester or further afield. Students will take responsibility for designing and leading on projects of their choice, linked with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This might for instance be about: Raising awareness about a development goal; Organising an event; Undertaking volunteering work.  This module provides students with an understanding of sustainable development in action. This is achieved by providing students with an opportunity to participate in a project which aims to address a real-world sustainable development challenge, in Leicester or further afield. The module aims to enhance students' employability skills by providing opportunities for them to develop their development challenges through Students will consider the characteristics of addressing sustainable

This module develops awareness and advanced knowledge of both theory and practice of the transmission and distribution of electrical power. The basic theory and rationale behind 3-phase power systems is given with an introduction to the power system network, which is then extended to modelling and analysis of power systems. The module will cover basic tools of power system analysis such as per unit representation, node equations simple mathematical models of power system components such as transmission lines, underground cables, transformers, induction machines, synchronous generators, loads and insulators. The power flow problem would be formulated and solution techniques discussed for analysing the flows in simple networks. A substantial portion of the module will be devoted to the study of distribution systems, covering aspects of planning and design of distribution networks, load modelling, application of capacitors, voltage regulation and harmonic analysis in these systems. These topics have relevant links to electrical building design and to the understanding and modelling of electricity consumption in general. The module is intended to be a companion to and run concurrently with

Module Description:
The module builds on the material developed in previous modules concerned with electronic principles and digital electronics.  Signal processing techniques are discussed and illustrated with design examples.  It will provide an understanding of continuous (analogue) and discrete (digital) signal processing systems used in fields such as electronics, communications, control and linear systems. The discussion of continuous systems is primarily concerned with linear time invariant systems, representation of signals in time and Frequency domain, Laplace transform, design of analogue filters.  The sampling Theory and the Z-transform are then discussed as an introduction to Digital signal processing.  Software implementation of the different continous and discrete systems will be carried out to support the theory delivered in lectures.  Real time implementations of discrete systems  such as discrete convolution will be discussed from the point of view of general purpose processors using a microprocessor. The module content is delivered through a combination of conventional lectures with some worked examples, tutorials and laboratroy based work.  The module is assessed by an end examination together with a coursework component consisting of a computer demonstration and personal interview.

Practice exercises, undertaken by the student for each topic in the indicative content with tutorial support, form an important component of the formative assessment of the module.  They are distributed throughout the module delivery and provide feedback of the student's grasp of the concepts and the ability to apply them to the solution of problems involving signal processing. The laboratory base component addresses the assimilation of practical design skills, training in the use of a range hardware/software resources, the ability to follow sign-posted lab exercises and bring innovative contributions to specified designs. The laboratory exercises are distributed strategically through the module delivery.  Each laboratory report is normally marked before the student attempts the next exercise.

Assessment Notes:
theoretical background and their practical skills in building a software firmware to control the DMU Dev-board with respect to the given requirement. The submission should include the full source code of the required software firmware. Each submission is then examined off line for compliance with the requirement and quality of the implementation. Since establishing authorship of software is a particular challenge, we require our students to perform a 20 to 30 minute long demonstration where the examiner aggressively tests the system and asks questions on the design, implementation and functionality of every aspect of  the control software prototype. Questions like "How did you do this?", "What is the behaviour of your system?" and "What will happen if we change the software in a particular way?" are used to gauge understanding and authorship. The final mark for a project is 0 if the student did not attend their demonstration regardless of the state of their submission. Otherwise, the assessment of the submission and the demonstration are used in conjunction to form the mark for the coursework requires the students to demonstrate their understanding of the requirement specification document. Assessment is individual and firmware system for the DMU Dev-board with respect to a given board (DMU Dev-board).

Module Description:
through practical experimentation. The module will cover the following subjects: •	Introduction: Definitions. Basic fluid dynamics and thermodynamics theory required to analyse turbomachinery. Blade aerodynamics •	Dimensional analysis and similitude •	Axial flow turbines – two dimensional theory, blade cascades •	Stall and surge in axial flow compressors •	Different configurations of gas turbines for aircraft and static power generation •	Radial flow turbines •	Nozzles and diffusers •	Hydraulic turbines (Francis, Kaplan, Pelton, fluid couplings) •	Cavitation and other loss phenomena  This module introduces the student to a range of turbomachines including fans, pumps, compressors, and turbines. Coverage is limited to those devices in which the working fluid is totally enclosed, so devices such as wind turbines (which are covered in another module) are excluded. The module will provide an opportunity to consolidate students’ understanding of basic thermodynamics and fluid dynamics and to apply this knowledge to analyse the performance of practical turbomachines. Performance will generally be analysed in terms of the energy absorbed by devices used to increase fluid pressure or head and energy produced by devices that expand fluid to a lower pressure or head, including devices that are driven by combustion of fuel such as gas turbines. Content is delivered through a combination of lectures that explain the relevant theory and laboratory exercises that consolidate this theory

Learning Outcomes:
 1.	To understand the theory that underpins an analysis of turbomachinery. (IET AHEP3: SM1p, SM1m, EA1p, EA1m, ET4p, ET4m); (IMechE AHEP3: SM1b, SM1m, EA1b, EA1m, EL4). [CW & Exam]. 2.	To be able to evaluate the energy efficiency and causes of loss of efficiency of a range of different turbomachines in different application contexts. (IET AHEP3: EA2p, EA2m, D2p, D2m, EP3p, EP3m); (IMechE AHEP3: EA2, D2, P3). [CW & Exam].

Module Description:
lines, underground cables, transformers, induction machines, synchronous generators, loads and insulators. The power flow problem would be formulated and solution techniques discussed for analysing the flows in large networks. Modelling of networks under balanced and unbalanced fault conditions and stability of power networks under steady state and transient conditions will be explored. Finally, we look at the analysis and design of distribution networks, electrical power quality and sources, effects and control solutions of harmonics. As an adjunct, HVDC systems and FACTS devices will be explored. The module is intended to be a companion to and run concurrently with ENGD3025 Power Electronics, which covers the mechanics of conventional and embedded power generation (synchronous generators and inverter-based generators). Assessment is by examination, a short piece of coursework, and laboratory sessions with a written report.    This module develops awareness and advanced nowledge of both theory and practice of the ransmission and dstribution of electrical power. This will start with the basic theory and rationale behind 3-phase power systems with an introduction to power system network, and extend this into the modelling and analysis of power systems. It will cover basic tools of power system analysis such as per unit representation, symmetrical components and machine phasor diagrams, derivation of mathematical models for power system components such as ransmission

student to the multidisciplinary and team nature of many engineering industry. This module has been specifically designed to expose the selection of components & materials, the necessary workshop and laboratories techniques. The key skill aspect will include understanding and practising project manage, leadership, risk management applied to a technical project that could involve communication of ideas within a team and wider (potentially international) audience, as well as the social and environmental aspects. Each group/team will have an academic assigned; and where possible an industrial mentor will also be assigned. The project title will be projects, helping to highlight individual strengths and weaknesses, which may help the individual in selecting a pathway to an engineering career. It will also help to prepare the student for being responsible for quality of their output, in particular conforming to required protocols, and managing technical uncertainty. The selected engineering project will give an opportunity for engineering students to learn and practise engineering design as well as key skills. The engineering design and practise will include design using appropriate technical information and engineering knowledge, problem solving, application and development of mathematical and computer models, the understanding and    The module has been designed to provide an opportunity for students to work on an engineering project as a multidisciplinary team, which will be similar to that found in industry.

a result of the group not submitting the essential component (i.e., the project brief and ethics form), this would be remedied by satisfactory submission of this component. In cases where the project itself has been inadequately carried out throughout its life-cycle, it would be impossible to complete a new project during the normal summer reassessment period. In these cases reassessment would require undertaking of a complete new project with a new proposal. This would require reassessment of the entire project and would run for the full two-term cycle. It is expected that, owing to the nature of the project, this would be the exception rather than the rule. to be ‘made good’ and the weaknesses addressed.

Module Description:
management, capacity, facilities planning, production planning and inventory control. Operations management is thus about procurement, production, distribution, warehousing, and retailing, with the objective of creating competitive advantage for the enterprise. Good operations are also well integrated with other functions in the company, which   The purpose of this module is to enable students to critically understand the role effective operations management has in a success of a firm. Whereas marketing focuses on the demand for the product, and whereas finance provides the capital for the product, operation management (OM) produces and delivers the product. In managing manufacturing or service operations several types of decisions are made including operations strategy, product design, process design, quality considered, and integrated into a whole. Students will learn to observe and analyze an organization from a systems- and process-perspective through learning to design, operate, and improve the systems that deliver goods and services through OM tools such as process flow diagrams, lean management, and decision trees. By the end of the course students will be provided with the analytical skills and managerial insights necessary to critically analyze a firm's operations decisions and practices. Indicative list of topics are presented below. •	operations strategies from the systems engineering perspective •	process analysis •	resource allocation optimisation and management •	inventory management •	queuing theory •	supply chain management •	quality management (six sigma principle, PDCA cycle) •	risk management •	lean systems •	simulating a service system means that everyone, no matter what their function or specialty, needs to know something about operations. This module will focus on how the "physics" of material, work and information flows from the systems engineering perspective. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are

Module Description:
and adapt to new challenges - for example in a world that may no longer sustain traditional economic models of growth? What are the strategic questions that industry should be asking and how does one manage the necessary strategies for change? Key concepts such as corporate social responsibility, green accounting and life- cycle analysis will be explored along with the practical organisational questions of environmental management and organisational change. This module will be benefit both practitioners wishing to develop their careers in the low-carbon industries of the present and future, and future academics wishing to critically explore the sustainability of engineering businesses in the future. The module will teach students how to handle complex issues both systematically and creatively,and to demonstrate self-direction, group working and originality in problem solving. It will develop their careers as competent professionals, whether in business or as researchers The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and reflect upon the role of business in a rapidly changing, globalised world. In particular it aims to identify the opportunities and threats for an industrial business arising from environmental  policy, legislation and societal change. As well as considering the changing environment in which businesses operate, time is spent exploring the steps a business can take to respond to the environmental challenges ahead; for example, through supply chain  management, logistics, life -cycle analysis, green accounting and carbon trading. Challenging and critical questions will be asked of the place of business in society now and in the future,namely - can an industrial business be a positive force for good? How do businesses learn, change

Module Description:
practical activities, and the use of case studies, students will develop these different approaches across various design contexts. Through will have the opportunity to assess the strengths and weaknesses of products, processes, services and systems will be explored and students A number of different approaches to designing more energy efficient the skills and expertise necessary, at each stage of the design process, to effectively facilitate and manage resource efficient design. The aim of this module is to provide students with an understanding of resource efficient design in both industrial and non-industrial contexts. Design will be seen to relate to both product and process, while resource efficiency will be interpreted as the ability to design out waste and design in the efficient use of natural resources. The module will adopt a 'whole systems' perspective to the introduction of students to the design process and will encourage them to analyse each stage of development in terms of its impact on resource use and overall energy consumption. Discussions will consider the role of the designer and the user when addressing the challenge of moving towards more sustainable consumption.

Learning Outcomes:
    1.	Examine resource use and energy consumption in the design processes for products and processes (services and systems). (AHEP3: SM6m, D3m, EL4, EA1m, P2, P4, G1, G4). [Critical Analysis & Essay]. 2.	Describe how a whole systems approach can be applied to designing products and processes. (AHEP3: SM4m, SM6m, EA4m, D1, D2, D7m, EL1, EL2, EL4, G4). [Critical Analysis & Essay]. 3.	Explain the relationships between design, resource use and sustainability, and the role of user behaviour in a low-carbon economy. (AHEP3: SM6m, EL1, EL2, EA1m, D1, D2, P4, G4). [Critical Analysis & Essay]. 4.	Explore resource reduction opportunities at different individual stages of the design process and the product development cycle. (AHEP3: SM6m, EA1m, EA6m, D2, D3m, D7m, EL4, P2, P4, G1, G4). [Critical Analysis & Essay]. 5.	Use conventional techniques and evaluate advanced approaches for the design of low energy products, services and systems, demonstrating originality for specific design challenges. (AHEP3: SM6m, EA6m, D2, D3m, D7m, EL4, EA1m, P2, P4, P9m, P10m, G1, G4). [Critical Analysis & Essay].

Module Description:
The module also teaches students self-direction, group working and originality in problem solving. The research methods and associated study skills parts of the module  provide students with the skills to successfully complete a research project. Teaching of Research Methods (RM) will be integrated with the sustainable engineering part, through coursework and assignments. RM Material includes: understanding the research of others, literature reviewing, research methodologies, data interpretation and analysis, research ethics, intellectual property and report writing. A central aim is to prepare students for their dissertation or research project with the assignments related to planning a research project. The engineering business part of this module is to enable students to understand and reflect upon the role of business in a rapidly changing, globalised world. It identifies opportunities and threats for industry arising from environmental policy, legislation and societal change, and explores how businesses respond to future environmental challenges: for example, through supply chain management, logistics, life -cycle analysis, green accounting and carbon trading. Challenging questions are asked such as: can industry be a positive force for good? How do businesses learn and adapt to new challenges and economic models? This module benefits practitioners in industry, and future academics exploring the sustainability of engineering businesses.

Assessment Notes:
Online Test (Assessment B) - will draw together the study skills sessions (critical writing, referencing, critical reading) through an online test composed of both multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions (with free text inputs) aimed at identifying the student ability to retrieve critical information from literature, identify aims and objectives and/or formulate them and reference appropriately.  Essay 2 (Assessment C) - This will require students to present a research proposal containing a critical analysis of a relevant engineering issue using key literature and demonstrating critical thinking and the appropriate use of referencing and writing style. In addition to the review, the report will include a research aim and objectives with a relevant methodology proposed and a research work plan. Any ethical issues or potential risks should also be highlighted. Essay 1 (Assessment A)- Students will be assessed according to the following criteria: a) Their ability to analyse corporate strategies and sustainability policies in terms of social and environmental impacts and potential opportunities for mitigation b) Understanding of how corporations identify, evaluate, and mitigate social and environmental impacts and their commitments to corporate social responsibility c) Ability to suggest one or more suitable methods with which to better align corporate practices, processes and products with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); and d) The ability to produce written reports to an appropriate academic standard. 

Reassessment:
Reassessment/deferral is by failed/deferred component. Online test: the reassessment test will include multiple choice questions and free text/short essay questions that are randomly selected. The probability to get the same questions as in the first attempt is in effect zero as there is a large pool of available questions. Additionally, the questions are revised and changed periodically. Essay 2:  reassessment is by either resubmission of the same Research proposal (suitable revised based of the tutor feedback) or a new one.

Module Description:
learning; reinforcement learning; mixed-integer linear programming; model-predictive control; operation management; and decision making under uncertainty.  The second part of the module is activity based, and applies the concepts studied in the first part to carefully selected real-world case studies from all stages of the energy value chain. Case studies could be drawn from: demand forecasting in multi-vector energy systems, renewable energy generation prediction, electric vehicle charge scheduling, model- predictive control of distributed energy systems, outage management in electricity grids, load management, energy theft detection, economic dispatch of power systems, consumer profiling, and energy market analysis. As energy systems become smarter, their data footprint increases drastically. It is imperative to be able to manage these large datasets, for the sustainability of the global energy system. Data management, as used here, includes data acquisition, cleaning, manipulation, processing, and storage. This module teaches students the key concepts of data analytics and its application to energy system design and operation. It starts with a revision of the fundamentals of scientific programming in Python, to provide students with the requisite skills for advanced topics later in the module. The Python programming language has been chosen by virtue of its popularity in industry and its plethora of open-source Data Science libraries. Students are further introduced to Statistics, Machine Learning, and Optimisation – to equip them with the skills required for solving moderately advanced problems in, but not limited to, uncertainty analysis; supervised and unsupervised machine

Assessment Notes:
The assessment of the module centres on a design study that is developed and pursued throughout the module delivery with seminar support, guidance and critical appraisal. There is continuous formative feedback. The student should therefore be fully informed of progress and performance as the module develops. The design study report allows the student to develop and demonstrate multi-disciplinary mechatronic system and AI design skills with the use of a case study. Students must present their works to enable verification of their own works.

Reassessment:
Both design study report and presentation can be delivered remotely. Reassessment will be by failed component.

Block mode delivery will be up to two x three hour sessions per day over four days (a maximum contact of 24 hours in the week).  Any module of greater than 24 contact hours will be delivered over two separate weeks (with a maximum of 48 hours contact). Each of the three hour sessions will be structured to provide, as far as possible, encapsulated learning.  Where the module spans more than one week, each constituent week will be developed to be as self-contained as are not contiguous).  Self-paced learning materials will be available for students to work through for modules that have an examined component.  Staff will be available by phone, email and discussion board, as well as for one-to-one visits before and after the taught component to discuss the academic elements of the course, completion of any coursework and preparation for any examination.

Module Description:
•	Conventional fuels: pros and cons of fuels used in transport sector, production issues, demand and availability, environmental factors, efficiency, health and safety impacts •	Low-carbon fuel types and energy vectors for transport applications: biofuels and syn-fuels, hydrogen, ammonia, electricity, etc., production and delivery •	Technologies and applications: lightweight/HGV, urban/long-range, public/private, buses, trains, maritime, aviation, etc. •	BEVs vs. FCEVs: energy density, scale-ability, cost, efficiency, safety, environmental impact •	Batteries, fuel cells, hydrogen storage, recharging/refuelling infrastructures •	Mobility service delivery and new business models •	Integration of power and transport sectors: smart recharging, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations, dispatchable electrolysis, hydrogen from CCS, demand side response (DSR), smart grids and smart cities •	Socio-economic and policy aspects of sustainable transport, market development •	Safety and practicality of low-carbon transport technologies   This module introduces the student to a range of low-carbon transport technologies and includes the energy supply chains that are essential to their ‘low-carbon’ classification. Thus, the technologies and operational factors of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) and alternatively fuelled vehicles (AFVs) are explored along with smart charging and vehicle-to-grid operations, dispatchable electrolysis for hydrogen production, fuel cell systems, ammonia, biofuel, synthetic fuel production and the integration of sustainable mobility systems with smart cities and smart grids. As well as technical concerns, other factors are addressed, such as, behavioural, social, financial, environmental and political issues within the context of a sustainable low-carbon economy.  Such knowledge will equip students to judge which low-carbon transport systems are most appropriate in any given situation. Content is delivered through a combination of lectures, seminars and laboratory sessions to provide theoretical knowledge that is enriched by practical experience and experimentation.  The following subjects are covered in this module:

Block mode delivery will be up to two x three hour sessions per day over four days (a maximum contact of 24 hours in the week).  Any module of greater than 24 contact hours will be delivered over two separate weeks (with a maximum of 48 hours contact). Each of the three hour sessions will be structured to provide, as far as possible, encapsulated learning.  Where the module spans more than one week, each constituent week will be developed to be as self-contained as the subject allows and a recap session will be provided at the beginning of the second week (which is particularly important when the two weeks are not contiguous).  Self-paced learning materials will be available for students to work through for modules that have an examined component.  Staff will be available by phone, email and discussion board, as well as for one-to-one visits before and after the taught component to discuss the academic elements of the course, completion of any coursework and preparation for any examination.

Self-paced learning materials will be available for students to work through for modules that have an examined component.  Staff will be available by phone, email and discussion board, as well as for one-to-one visits before and after the taught component to discuss the academic elements of the course, completion of any coursework and preparation for any examination.

Expected Methods of Delivery:
A general note on delivery of block teaching for the Postgraduate Engineering Apprenticeship course This module is intended to be taught in block mode as well as being taught weekly over a semester. Block mode delivery will be up to two x three hour sessions per day over four days (a maximum contact of 24 hours in the week). Any module of greater than 24 contact hours will be delivered over two separate weeks (with a maximum of 48 hours contact). Each of the three hour sessions will be structured to provide, as far as possible, encapsulated learning. Where the module spans more than one week, each constituent week will be developed to be as self-contained as the subject allows and a recap session will be provided at the beginning of the second week (which is particularly important when the two weeks are not contiguous). Self-paced learning materials will be available for students to work through for modules that have an examined component. Staff will be available by phone, email and discussion board, as well as for one-to-one visits before and after the taught component to discuss the academic elements of the course, completion of any coursework and preparation for any examination.     This module is delivered to both attending and distance learners. The core delivery system is the module shell on the Blackboard VLE. For attending students, there are taught sessions comprising a mix of formal lectures, seminar exercises (which may include use of computers), and class discussion. Written 'lessons', similar to book chapters, are also provided on the VLE in parallel with the lectures. These include exercises for the students to do in their own time. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is incorporated into module delivery, according to current Faculty guidance. This includes making teaching material available online in advance of classes; use of lecture recording through DMU Replay wherever possible, or providing alternatives; and designing text and presentation material to meet the needs of all learners. All material is also designed to meet the needs of distance learners. Lecture:36 Fieldtrip:2 Practical:4 Online Learning:20 Reading:38 Reflection:20 Consolidation:30

The module will teach students how future academics wishing to critically explore the sustainability of careers in the low-carbon industries of the present and future, and This module will be benefit both practitioners wishing to develop their questions of environmental management and organisational change. cycle analysis will be explored along with the practical organisational as corporate social responsibility, green accounting and life- does one manage the necessary strategies for change? Key concepts such What are the strategic questions that industry should be asking and how sustain traditional economic models of growth? and adapt to new challenges - for example in a world that may no longer The aim of this module is to enable students to understand and reflect upon the role of business in a rapidly changing, globalised world. In particular it aims to identify the opportunities and threats for an industrial business arising from environmental  policy, legislation and societal change. As well as considering the changing environment in which businesses operate, time is spent exploring the steps a business can take to respond to the environmental challenges ahead; for example, through supply chain  management, logistics, life -cycle analysis, green accounting and carbon trading. Challenging and critical questions will be asked of the place of business in society now and in the future,namely - can an industrial business be a positive force for good? How do businesses learn, change

Module Description:
The module introduces students to the concept of an industrial system linking different types of industry including raw material processing, manufacturing and waste processing that combine to satisfy consumer demand. It explains the ways in which energy and resource use can be identified at each stage of a product life-cycle and how the associated environmental impacts can be identified and mitigated. An overview of key industries is given so that students can appreciate the origin and scale of environmental impacts from different types of manufacturing. Life-cycle analysis is explained with particular reference to the economic input-output life cycle assessment method. The module teaches students to view industrial systems from the perspective of the energy consumed and the impacts upon the environment as well as the more traditional view of the material and information flows. Key international standards relevant to sustainable manufacturing such as ISO 14001 (environmental management), ISO14040 (life-cycle assessment) and BS EN 16001 (energy management) are described. A technical approach is taken throughout the module and it is assumed that the analysis of cost-benefits will be explained in another module.

By the end of the course students will be provided with the analytical skills and managerial insights necessary to critically analyze a firm's operations decisions and practices. through learning to design, operate, and improve the systems that and analyze an organization from a systems- and process-perspective considered, and integrated into a whole. Students will learn to observe engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are information flows from the systems engineering perspective. Systems Indicative list of topics are presented below. •	operations strategies from the systems engineering perspective •	process analysis •	resource allocation optimisation and management •	inventory management •	queuing theory •	supply chain management •	quality management (six sigma principle, PDCA cycle) •	risk management •	lean systems •	simulating a service system   The purpose of this module is to enable students to critically understand the role effective operations management has in a success of a firm. Whereas marketing focuses on the demand for the product, and whereas finance provides the capital for the product, operation management (OM) produces and delivers the product. In managing manufacturing or service operations several types of decisions are made including operations strategy, product design, process design, quality management, capacity, facilities planning, production planning and inventory control. Operations management is thus about procurement, production, distribution, warehousing, and retailing, with the objective of creating competitive advantage for the enterprise. Good operations are also well integrated with other functions in the company, which means that everyone, no matter what their function or specialty, needs to know something about operations. This module will focus on how the "physics" of material, work and

Module Description:
 This module forms the EPA requirements for the Level 7 post graduate engineer apprenticeship. The EPA is a 0 credit must pass and must take module. The EPA involves a process of assessments around two competence requirements; occupation competence and professional competence. Occupation competence is first assessed by the employer via a viva interview with supporting portfolio of evidence. Professional competence and verification of the occupational competence process undertaken is then performed by the relevant professional engineering institution (PEI). The outcome of the EPA (pass/fail) is determined by the outcome of the professional competence evaluation (pass/not pass) which is itself based in part on the occupation competence evaluation outcome (pass/fail). The EPA should start once the Gateway 2 requirements for the Post graduate engineer apprenticeship have been met. The Assessment notes explains in detail the EPA assessment requirements.

Assessment Notes:
Furthermore, it is the student's product that is a principal focus of the assessment, as is the student's ability to manage and undertake the project. Hence, the 100% coursework assessment for this module is necessary. Each project submission will be assessed on general criteria associated with all projects, and on specific criteria that reflect the individual requirements of a particular project.  The general criteria focus on those aspects (skills/knowledge) of the project work that all students should exhibit. The specific criteria refer to the substantive work    undertaken by the student to achieve that particular project's product. impossible to assess students via a standard end of year examination.
