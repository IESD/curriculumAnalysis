Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
This programme offers students an opportunity to go into considerable depth in the areas of Economics beyond that provided by the half pathway programmes in Economics. The aim is to allow students to develop rigorous skills in the main subject area, and to equip themselves with a valued degree that helps builds strong transferable skills. The programme of study will have sound theoretical underpinning from an economic perspective and will enable students to develop proficiency in the core disciplines of macroeconomics and microeconomics in an international context. This will be supported by competency in analytical skills in use and manipulation of numerical data.  In designing this undergraduate programme this course provision has responded to employer and student demands and the need for students to enhance their degree skills, to compete in a very competitive employment market. The current state of the world economy has seen the subject of Economics being brought onto the centre stage of policy analysis and as such the need for sound economic skills and competencies will be high, for the foreseeable future. The programmes allow the option of Erasmus/study abroad year allowing an invaluable international experience. The programme also allows the option of a placement year in industry to practically develop the students CV.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
 The main teaching methods used are lectures and tutorials / seminars within the teaching sessions. The diverse range of modules on the programme provides opportunity for experiencing a range of teaching and learning approaches. Assessment by a mixture of coursework of both a formative and a summative nature and a number of traditional exams will be used. Presentations and group work is significantly used in assessments, as a way of building transferable skills that will enhance employability. Students will also make extensive use of IT based learning, through the University's Blackboard virtual learning environment.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
     The proposed single honours BSc in Economics will be a complementary UG programme to the current BA (Hons) Economics. The recruitment for the single honours BA has been strong with 54 students recruited in 2016. The BSc will allow students who wish to study economics, with a more quantitative slant a suitable programme of study at DMU. The BSc in Economics will build strong transferable skills in relevant quantitative methods and statistical techniques. This economics programme will allow students to develop the subject specific skills of quantification, evaluation and design to an advanced level. The study of economics will be supported by modules that provide students with understanding to deal with and organise data in a comprehensive way. The programme of study will have sound theoretical underpinning from an economic perspective and will enable students to develop proficiency in the core disciplines of macroeconomics and microeconomics supported by a strong competency in analytical skills in use and manipulation of numerical data. Employers value the transferable skills of well evidenced empirical analysis and economist that are numerate and able to communicate economic ideas in reports and public audits, as required in many professions that economist join. In designing this undergraduate programme this course provision has responded to employer and student demands (we have an increasing number of placement students joining the Government Economic Service – GES) and the need for students to enhance their degree skills, to compete in a very competitive employment market. The current state of the world economy has seen the subject of Economics being brought onto the centre stage of policy analysis and as such the need for sound economic skills and competencies will be high, for the foreseeable future.

These concepts, tools and principles play a key role in reasoning. •	Economic policy at both the microeconomic and macroeconomic levels •	The applications of economics. Students discover how to apply relevant economic principles and reasoning to a variety of applied topics. They are also aware of how economics can be applied to design, guide and interpret commercial, economic, social and environmental policy. •	An ability to articulate, communicate and present economic arguments to both specialist and non-specialist audiences. 	Subject specific skills •	Abstraction - from the study of economic principles and models, students see how one can abstract the      essential features of complex systems and provide a useable framework for evaluation and assessment of the effects of policy or other exogenous events. •	Analysis, deduction and induction - economic reasoning can be highly deductive, and logical analysis is applied to assumption-based models. Inductive reasoning is important. The development of such analytical skills enhances students' problem solving and decision-making ability. •	Marginal considerations - economists are trained to recognise that important decisions often relate to small variations in key variables and parameters •	Opportunity cost and scarcity. Opportunity cost allows economists to think about the cost in terms of all resources including time. •	Markets and market failure -. Students learn to recognise these market externalities and to evaluate how policy and or private bargaining can achieve improved allocations Learning outcomes the student should know and be able to do upon completion of the DipHE (including the above) 	Knowledge and understanding •	Relevant quantitative methods and computing techniques. These include appropriate mathematical and statistical methods, including econometrics. •	The nature, sources and uses of both quantitative and qualitative data and an ability to select and apply appropriate methods that economists might use to analyse such data. and the differing methods of analysis that have been and are used by •	An appreciation of the history and development of economic ideas economists. •	An ability to apply economic reasoning to applied topics. 	Subject specific skills •	Quantification, evaluation and design - data, their sources, and their effective organisation, presentation and analysis, are important in economics •	Framing - through the study of economics, a student learns how to decide what should be taken as given or fixed for the purposes of setting up and solving a problem •	Numeracy, statistical and computing skills are necessary to handle numerical information. Presentation skills are needed to communicate such quantitative information in usable ways, and particularly to give critical and coherent summary representations of data that cannot be readily absorbed raw. Learning outcomes the student should know and be able to do upon completion of the BSc (Hons) (including the above) 	Knowledge and understanding •	A critical understanding of analytical methods, both theory and model-based 	 	 	 •	An ability to relate differences in economic policy recommendations to differences in the theoretical and empirical features •	An ability to discuss, analyse and evaluate government policy and to assess the performance of the UK and other economies and of the global economy. •	An understanding of verbal, graphical, mathematical and relationship between them. 	Subject specific skills •	Incentives and psychological biases The ability to think thinking, and the roles of opportunities, strategies, outcomes, •	Expectations and surprises.

The MSc in Economics has a sound theoretical underpinning from an economic perspective and enables students to apply the modern theories, analytical skills, and data analytics to real world, contemporary and evolving problems. For example, the current pandemic has restructured the economy in many countries which affects the labour market and unemployment. In addition, current events such as Brexit and the regional trade agreements such as the CPTPP pose some questions of how globalization would evolve in the future. Students will have the opportunity to discuss and propose solutions to these emerging problems.  The programme of study l builds strong transferable skills in relevant quantitative methods and statistical techniques. It  allows students to develop the subject specific skills of quantification, evaluation and design to an advanced level and is supported by modules that provide students with an understanding to handle and organise data in a comprehensive way. Employers value the transferable skills of well evidenced empirical analysis and economists that are numerate and able to communicate economic ideas in reports and public audits, as required in many professions that economists join.  Consequently, this programme responds to employer and student demands and the need for students to enhance their degree skills, for a very competitive employment market. The current state of the world economy has seen the subject of Economics being brought onto the centre stage of policy analysis and as such, graduates should be in a position to contribute to that analysis.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims


Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:


Structure and Regulations:
     The aim of the programme is to provide a flexible Economics half pathway which will join with complementary subject areas, to allow students the option of tailoring their study of Economics to their own areas of interest and provide significant employment opportunities in a variety of careers. Recognition of the realisation that students are increasingly choosing to study economics jointly with another subject area is the basic rationale for the suite of Economics half pathways. The programme of study will have sound theoretical underpinning from an economic perspective and will enable students to develop proficiency in the core disciplines of macroeconomics and microeconomics and related study areas in an international context. In the first year (level 4) all students will be required to take the core modules needed to build the foundations of knowledge for the Economics (joint) pathway programmes under consideration. Level five and six modules will progressively build learning and knowledge. At level five and six elective modules can be studied along side the core Economics modules. The elective modules are more applied in design and will allow students to study Economics in practical contexts that will enhance their employment skills. The spine of core Economics modules will deliver the key modules which feed through all 3 years of undergraduate study, namely Macroeconomics, Microeconomics. With the Economics half joining with the associated joint programme half, students will benefit from a truly cross function learning experience. The programmes allow the option of an Erasmus/study abroad year allowing an invaulable international experience. Students of International Relations at De Montfort University are required to develop expertise in understanding the global political, economic and social forces that provide the framework within which contemporary societies are developing. As International Relations forms only a small part of the A Level curriculum Level Four is a broad introduction to the concerns of the discipline. Students are introduced to key concepts and ideas about the nature of international relations as well as studying how individuals, states, international organisations and the international community as a whole act in world politics. They also focus on key issues such as conflict, human rights, international law and development. An important part of the program at DMU is developing students' awareness of global economic processes, so there is an important focus on international economics and issues of free and fair trade. In Level Five they deepen their understanding of current theoretical approaches to the study of international relations. This helps them to refine their ability to undertake further study in International Political Economy or the analyse issues effectively. They can European Union. They also have the option to undertake introductory training in quantitative and qualitative research methods and a short practical placement. In Level Six students apply this base of knowledge and skills to specialist modules on important contemporary issues like international security or the impact of globalisation in Latin America and Africa. All Joint Honours students have the opportunity independent research project on an issue of their own choice in one of undertake a supervised their subjects. This is an important capstone assessment that brings together all the knowledge and developed during their studies. skills that they have In addition to the subject knowledge that students learn during this programme, they also build up a Students of Politics and International range of important skills that will be vital for their future careers. Relations are required to think in a systematic and critical way about the problems that they look at. They understand the tools and techniques of social science research as well as the limitations of the data it produces. To be successful, they need to enhance their skills in written and oral communication in order to make persuasive arguments based on a wide variety of information sources. As part of the teaching on the course they will also have opportunities to increase their skills in teamwork, negotiation and problem solving through case studies, placements and simulations. Throughout the programme there is an emphasis on students reflecting on their own practices and using constructive feedback from peers and tutors to improve their own performance. This helps them to develop their ability to be resilient, flexible and to cope with the challenges of a wide range of potential job roles

Entry Requirements (General):
     Applicants will normally hold a good Honours degree or overseas equivalent, in any subject; or a professional qualification deemed to be of equivalent standing. For an applicant whose first language is not English, an IELTS score of 6.5 or equivalent is essential. PRE-ENTRY INFORMATION Evidence of English language skills: normally applicants are required to have gained an IELTS score of 6.5 (with a total of 5.5 in each component)  Exemptions from providing evidence of English Language proficiency may arise if an applicant has: - Gained their undergraduate degree from a UK university - Applicants should also be able to provide evidence of their ability to manage time, work with others, present, critique and write clearly and concisely.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
 This programme serves to meet the growing demand for students to be conversant with the basic principles of economics and the associated joint pathway of International Relations. It is specifically for students that have had some, but limited, exposure to the subject areas and need to develop their ability to the applicability of the main concepts within the wider business and organisational environment. Whilst there has long been recognition of the need for International Relations programmes  for students seeking to move beyond or extend their undergraduate experience, there is now a growing demand for a similar level of proficiency in economic theory and its application to decision making in the public and private spheres International Relations is an internationally recognised area of interest to all types of organisation, at the local regional, national or global level. The topic also has relevance to a wide variety of professions and careers and, as such, offers a growing area of employment. The link to the study of economics is particularly provided by the impact of the macro-economic factors on the policy making agendas of local authorities, national governments, international trade associations and world forums. The effectiveness of policy making is also dependent upon the effectiveness of such poliices in changing peoples behaviour which creates a direct link with the study of micro-economics.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
      Appropriate strategies will be used to deliver substantial Programme material. Traditional lectures may be used and these may be supported by tutorials or seminars where fuller appraisal and discussion is possible, and where important cognitive skills such as analysis, independent thought and synthesis may be developed. Case studies may also be used as a means of relating theory to practical application and where appropriate there will be small group exercises culminating in presentations or debates. Justification for this strategy follows from the nature of the recruitment to Masters programmes which is both multi-experiential and multi-cultural. Time spent on the Programme involving students studying, living and working or communicating amongst such a rich mix of experiences and cultures helps to foster a range of professional transferable skills. These will range from adapting to new approaches, through to critique of contemporary business practice. The aim is to strike a balance between individual, time constrained assessment (presentations and examinations) and coursework.  In examinations candidates are required to provide concise and logical answers under time constraint, whereas coursework allows more reflection and research in compiling assignments and reports.  The strategy generally is to focus more on the latter, to allow the opportunity to explore specialist topics in greater depth. The Postgraduate Modular Scheme is not prescriptive in terms of the length/ duration of assessment, so there is no set tariff for the word length of coursework assessments.  This allows Module Leaders to consider an appropriate mix of activity within the module assessment to enable candidates to demonstrate learning outcomes.  However, the programme team has sought to ensure that there is equivalence of overall student achievement for a standard (15 credit) module. Where a candidate fails a module on first submission, they are required to undertake a reassessment.  The compensatory fail rule will only apply to modules that have been failed on reassessment. Candidates will be permitted, subject to the approval of the Programme Board, to compensate for marginal failure (35-39%) in ONE module on the programme, provided that they achieve an overall average of at least 50% at the end of the programme. Thus, a candidate who fails a module on reassessment with a mark of 35-39% will be allowed to continue on the programme at their own risk. In such a case, failure to achieve an overall average of 50% at the end of the programme will result in the failure of the MSc International Business and Finance Programme. This does not apply to the Dissertation module. Where a module on this programme has two or more assessment elements, then the candidate must normally achieve a minimum of 35% for each element plus a minimum of 40% overall to pass that module. This applies to all core modules and most electives. Any exception to this rule will be specifically brought to the delegate's attention before they enrol onto an elective

            Economics The aim of the programme is to provide a flexible Economics half pathway which will join with complementary subject areas, to allow students the option of tailoring their study of Economics to their own areas of interest and provide significant employment opportunities in a variety of careers. Recognition of the realisation that students are increasingly choosing to study economics jointly with another subject area is the basic rationale for the suite of Economics half pathways. The programme of study will have sound theoretical underpinning from an economic perspective and will enable students to develop proficiency in the core disciplines of macroeconomics and microeconomics and related study areas in an international context. In the first year  (level 4) all students will be required to take the core modules needed to build the foundations of knowledge for the Economics (joint) pathway programmes under consideration. Level five and six modules will progressively build learning and knowledge. At level five and six elective modules can be studied along side the core Economics modules. The elective modules are more applied in design and will allow students to study Economics in practical contexts that will enhance their employment skills. The spine of core Economics modules will deliver the key modules which feed through all 3 years of undergraduate study, namely Macroeconomics, Microeconomics. With the Economics half joining with the associated joint programme half, students will benefit from a truly cross function learning experience. The programmes allow the option of an Erasmus/study abroad year allowing an invaulable international experience. Finance A rigorous academic approach to accounting at level one to underpin future studies. Delivered with specific reference to the needs of non specialists initially and in a limited technical manner to equip students for their future study of finance. A use of modern information technology will underpin the course to include orientation with typical commercially available software packages and custom designed in house packages. Lectures will review modern techniques and interpretive practices allowing students to discriminate between finance techniques and expected outcomes from both a practical managerial viewpoint and a more traditional theoretical viewpoint. At level two and particularly level three the students will be able to select and pursue their own particular interests from an appropriate range of option modules including an opportunity to pursue specific interest and/or research via a finance project. To this end a research module is core at level two. However a core of essential modules will imposed on the course. Opportunities will be offered to look at the finance issues of organisations from recognised theoretical bases.

Entry Requirements (General):
      Applicants will normally hold a good Honours degree or overseas equivalent, in any subject; or a professional qualification deemed to be of equivalent standing. For an applicant whose first language is not English, an IELTS score of 6.5 or equivalent is essential. PRE-ENTRY INFORMATION Evidence of English language skills: normally applicants are required to have gained an IELTS score of 6.5 (with at least 5.5 in each componenent). Exemptions from providing evidence of English Language proficiency may arise if an applicant has: - Gained their undergraduate degree from a UK university Applicants should also be able to provide evidence of their ability to manage time, work with others, present, critique and write clearly and concisely.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
 This programme will serve to meet the growing demand for students to be conversant with the basic principles of economics and the associated joint pathway of finance. It is specifically for students that will have had some, but limited, exposure to the subject areas and need to develop their ability to the applicability of the main concepts within the wider business and organisational environment. Whilst there has long been recognition of the need for business and finance programmes for students seeking to move beyond or extend their undergraduate experience, there is now a growing demand for a similar level of proficiency in economic theory and its application to decision making in the public and private spheres. Finance is a well established area of interest to all types of organisation, whether the focus is on profit or the provision of not-for-profit services. The topic also has relevance to a wide variety of professions and careers and, as such, offers a growing area of employment. The link between the two disciplines  is particularly provided by the impact of the macro-economic environment upon the financial environment and by the consideration of the micro-environment and how the behaviour of individual financial decision makers can influence the choices of an organisation. Awareness of the limitations of individuals in making rational decisions is a growing area of concern in the finacial industries.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
      Appropriate strategies will be used to deliver substantial Programme material.  Traditional lectures may be used and these may be supported by tutorials or seminars where fuller appraisal and discussion is possible, and where important cognitive skills such as analysis, independent thought  and synthesis may be developed.  Case studies may also be used as a means of relating theory to practical application and where appropriate there will be small group exercises culminating in presentation or debates. Justification for this strategy follows from the nature of the recruitment to Masters programmes which is both multi-experiential and multi-cultural.  Time spent on the Programme involving students studying, living and working or communicating amongst such a rich mix of experiences and cultures helps to foster a range of professional transferable skills.  These will range from adapting to new approaches, through to critique of contemporary business practice. The aim is to strike a balance between individual, time constrained assessment (presentations and examinations) and coursework.  In examinations candidates are required to provide concise and logical answers under time constraint, whereas coursework allows more reflection and research in compiling assignments and reports.  The strategy generally is to focus more on the latter, to allow the opportunity to explore specialist topics in greater depth. The Postgraduate Modular Scheme is not prescriptive in terms of the length/duration of assessment, so there is no set tariff for the word length of coursework assessments.  This allows Module Leaders to consider an appropriate mix of activity within the module assessment to enable candidates to demonstrate learning outcomes.  However, the programme team has sought to ensure that there is equivalence of overall student achievement for a standard (15 credit) module. Where a candidate fails a module on the first submission, they are required to undertake a reassessment.  The compensatory fail rule will only apply to modules that have been failed on reassessment. Candidates will be permitted, subject to the approval of the Programme Board, to compensate for marginal failure (35-39%) in ONE module on the programme, provided that they achieve an overall average of at least 50% at the end of the programme.  Thus, a candidate who fails a module on reassessment with a mark of 35-39% will be allowed to continue on the programme at their own risk.  In such a case, failure to achieve an overall average of 50% at the end of the programme will result in the failure of the MSc International Business and Finance Programme.  This does not apply to the Dissertation module. When a module on this programme has two or more assessment elements, then the candidate must normally achieve a minimum of 35% for each element plus a minimum of 40% overall to pass that module.  This applies to all core modules and most electives.  Any exception to this rule will be be specifically brought to the delegate's attention before they enrol onto an elective.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
  This programme serves to meet the growing demand for students to be conversant with the basic principles of economics and the associated joint pathway of Marketing. It is specifically for students that have had some, but limited, exposure to the subject areas and need to develop their ability to the applicability of the main concepts within the wider business and organisational environment. Students choosing to combine marketing with economics are exposed to a course that develops in-depth knowledge and expertise in a number of different aspects of marketing while also exploring how marketing interacts with the other functional areas within organisations. Students analyse markets, to apply marketing theories to different situations, to solve business problems and to identify marketing opportunities. They also gain different perspectives of marketing's role within organisations. By studying these two disciplines they contrast multiple approaches to conceptualising individual and organisational decisions and a greater range of techniques for analysing such decisions. The macro-economic dimensions enable a deeper understanding of the context within which marketing decisions are made and the micro-economic decision theory provides an alternative mode of enquiry to those following a marketing tradition.

Structure and Regulations:
       Business Management The Joint degree provides students with a programme that enables them to study all business subject areas whilst also specialising in a particular subject discipline for 50% of their programme. The joint degree is therefore especially attractive to students who wish to combine an excellent all round undertstanding of business but may already have identified an intended graduate career path within a particular subject discipline. The degree is structured to enable students to tailor their programme of study to reflect personal or future career interests and may also be extended to a four year programme, by either taking a work placement or study overseas opportunity. Economics The aim of the programme is to provide a flexible Economics half pathway which will join with complementary subject areas, to allow students the option of tailoring their study of Economics to their own areas of interest and provide significant employment opportunities in a variety of careers. Recognition of the realisation that students are increasingly choosing to study economics jointly with another subject area is the basic rationale for the suite of Economics half pathways. The programme of study will have sound theoretical underpinning from an economic perspective and will enable students to develop proficiency in the core disciplines of macroeconomics and microeconomics and related study areas in an international context. In the first year  (level 4) all students will be required to take the core modules needed to build the foundations of knowledge for the Economics (joint) pathway programmes under consideration. Level five and six modules will progressively build learning and knowledge. At level five and six elective modules can be studied along side the core Economics modules. The elective modules are more applied in design and will allow students to study Economics in practical contexts that will enhance their employment skills. The spine of core Economics modules will deliver the key modules which feed through all 3 years of undergraduate study, namely Macroeconomics, Microeconomics. With the Economics half joining with the associated joint programme half, students will benefit from a truly cross function learning experience. The programmes allow the option of an Erasmus/study abroad year allowing an invaulable international experience.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
A rigorous academic approach to accounting at level one to underpin future studies. Delivered with specific reference to the needs of non-specialists initially and in a limited technical manner to equip students for their future study of finance. A use of modern information technology will underpin the course to include orientation with typical commercially available software packages and custom designed in-house packages. Lectures will review modern techniques and interpretive practices allowing students to discriminate between finance techniques and expected outcomes from both a practical managerial viewpoint and a more traditional theoretical viewpoint. At level two and particularly level three the students will be able to select and pursue their own particular interests from an appropriate range of option modules including an opportunity to pursue specific interest and/or research via a finance project. To this end a research module is core at level two. However a core of essential modules will imposed on the course. Opportunities will be offered to look at the finance issues of organisations from recognised theoretical bases.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
Formal lectures and tutorials but with an emphasis on giving students increasing responsibility for their own learning. Assessment mainly by courseworks of both a formative and a summative nature but a small number of traditional exams may be used depending on module choices. Some multiple- choice tests may be used especially at level one. Case work and real life examples will be a feature of the course especially at the higher levels. Problem solving will also underpin many assessment activities. Group work will be encouraged at an appropriate frequency at various levels. Individual research will be encouraged especially at level three. Independent IT-led work will be a feature of the bespoke finance modules.

Structure and Regulations:


Learning Outcomes:
                    What a student should know and be able to do upon completion of the course. Knowledge & Understanding Finance programmes aim to allow students to study and appreciate the nature, role and processes of finance as demonstrated within the current economic environment adn recognise and appreciate the changes, which have taken (and are taking) place in the subject area. The student will develop an understanding of the nature of finance, in a business context, in free market economies primarily in the developed world. The Finance degree is both technical and non-technical and designed to examine finance from both a practical and an academic viewpoint. Year One is a general overview where you will be introduced to the concept of finance and develop the necessary mathematical skills for application in the subject. Years Two and Three focus on core topics, such as Corporate Finance, Econometrics, Equity and Fixed Income Valuation, Investments and Portfolio Management and Financial Derivatives, which form the basis for the modern day study and practical application of finance. On successful completion of year two, students have the option to undertake a placement year in industry if they wish. Finance programmes are aimed at those students who wish to keep their career paths open but still gain a thorough, detailed knowledge of a key business area. Generic skills such as research skills, report writing, presentation skills and communication skills are embedded across the programme while employability skills are a key focus of all Business School programmes. Cognitive Skills Develop and apply a capacity for critical evaluation, constructive argument and the acquisition of evidence. Develop an ability to analyse and draw reasoned conclusions to both structured and unstructured problems. Locate and deploy data from a variety of sources to aid management decisions. Demonstrate academic integrity by acknowledgement and referencing. Demonstrate a capacity for independent and self-managed deeper learning. Apply numeracy skills within a commercial context. Communicate effectively via a variety of media including spoken, written and electronic. This includes the ability to structure the medium and 'message' for specified audiences.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
    The BA (Hons) Accounting and Business Management Joint degree takes a two-pronged approach in its design. Joint programmes are designed for those students who wish to gain a thorough knowledge of two key subject areas. The Joint degree provides an excellent general education in Business with an opportunity to specialise in areas of interest and/or career aspiration. This programme offers you an opportunity to go into considerable depth in the areas of Accounting and Business Management but is more prescriptive in the areas of study due to the limited number of modules available to a subject in a Joint programme. The Accounting side of the programme is designed for those students wishing to study accounting from an academic viewpoint but who also wish to go into some technical depth in specific aspects. Accounting courses are aimed at those students who wish to keep their career paths open but still gain a thorough, detailed knowledge of a key business area. The Business side of the Joint programme is designed to provide a broad base of business function knowledge and experience so that you are well grounded in basic business concepts, ideas, models and methodologies.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
     The programme is designed to provide a career entry opportunity for full-time students as well as a career development opportunity for practising managers, from various backgrounds, to enhance and develop their risk managment skills. The programme commences with an induction process, incorporating the fundamentals of management and management education. The induction also introduces students to appropriate skill areas, to the Programme and University. An emphasis on self-evaluation and ownership of the participants' own learning process is central to the programme and is formalised within the reflective practice element of the programme. The aim of the programme is to balance theoretical analysis with practical application to develop a critical and questioning approach to the conceptual underpinnings of risk management. To this end the programme leads with core taught modules that critically examine the scope of generic risk managment, business continuity and crisis management, the internal control of risk and different approaches  to risk management decisions.  The elective modules allow students to specialise in relevent risk-related topics which permit them to consider areas of interest in more depth. The final part of the programme allows a choice between a traditional Dissertation or an Executive Company Project. The Dissertation tends to be motivated by the participant's personal interest and starts with an extended literature review and may use a positivist research methodology in testing theoretical propositions from the literature, taking a theory-practice-theory route. The Executive Company Project tends to be motivated by the participant's work experience and employer or sponsors current issue(s).The methodology adopted for the project will be less positivist and more holistic in stance, taking more of a practice-theory-practice route. The holistic/integrated learning experience of the programme is finalised in the Dissertation/Executive Company Project through continuation of reflective practice, in setting the context of this work within the learning experience of the entire programme. Research of  top quality from within the Business School, as well experience of running a highly regarded MBA Risk Management module, has been used to inform the curriculum to produce a distinctive programme. The philosophy that specialist research should underpin teaching is widely evident in the programme.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
   The structure fosters an integrated learning approach to risk management education. The learning and teaching methods embrace a range of approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in postgraduate management education. These include traditional lectures, tutorials, seminars, workshops, case study analysis, audio-visual presentations, guest lectures, collaborative group work, such as presentations and projects, individual presentations, simulations and computer modelling. The programme aims to go beyond the traditional focus on subject specific knowledge and technical competence in using the tools, techniques and methodologies of Risk Management to focus on the multi-disciplinary and holistic nature of Risk Management and to ensure the development of self-critical and reflective practice skills to augment theoretical and practical competence. On the programme it is expected that participants should take a major responsibility for their own learning. Participants are expected to engage in their learning environment in a meaningful and proactive manner to aid experiential learning. This learning approach aims to utilise the valuable learning opportunities provided by the diversity of knowledge and experience within the cohort. The teaching philosophy is one of mutual commitment to the educational process from both the Faculty and the participants.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims


Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
The structure fosters an integrated learning approach to risk management education. The learning and teaching methods embrace a range of approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in postgraduate management education. These include traditional lectures, tutorials, seminars, workshops, case study analysis, audio-visual presentations, guest lectures, collaborative group presentation or work projects, individual presentations, simulations and computer modelling.  The programme balances assessment methods such as individual and group assessments, presentations, examinations, case study analysis and reports. A wide range of assessment opportunities are used to develop students’ skills for profession employment. Students are supported via feedback provided to develop their skills as they work on different assessment strategies. Rationale for the mixture of assessments is to assess different skills which enable students to collect, prioritize, assimilate and disseminate information underpinning risk management. This approach also allows the opportunity to explore specialist topics in greater depth.  On the programme it is expected that participants should take a major responsibility for their own learning. The students are expected to engage in their learning environment in a meaningful and proactive manner to aid experiential learning. This learning approach aims to utilise the valuable learning opportunities provided by the diversity of knowledge and experience within the cohort. The teaching philosophy is one of mutual commitment to the educational process from both the students and the Faculty.

Structure and Regulations:
  The programme is designed to provide a career entry opportunity for full-time students as well as a career development opportunity for practising managers, from various backgrounds, to enhance and develop their risk management skills. On this programme, students will gain analytical, problem solving, ability to quantify risks, ethical decision making, people management and leadership skills and knowledge to succeed in the fast-paced corporate world. Knowledge and skills on management of risks are key parts of risk review, which will enable the graduates to manage contemporary risks more effectively in the future, and prompting to think about new risks that are emerging. The programme balances theoretical analysis with practical application to develop a critical and questioning approach to the conceptual underpinnings of risk management. To this end the programme leads with modules that critically examine the scope of generic risk management, business continuity and crisis management, the internal control of risk, different approaches to risk management decisions, and specialize in relevant risk-related topics. The final part of the programme allows a choice between a Dissertation or an Executive Company Project. The Dissertation tends to be motivated by the participant's personal interest and starts with an extended literature review and may use relevant research methodologies in testing theoretical propositions from the literature, taking a theory-practice- theory route. The Executive Company Project tends to be motivated by the participant's work experience and employer or sponsors current issue(s). The methodology adopted for the project will be less positivist and more holistic in stance, taking more of a practice-theory-practice route. The holistic/integrated learning experience of the programme is finalised in the Dissertation/Consultancy Project through continuation of reflective practice, in setting the context of this work within the learning experience of the entire programme.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
   The structure fosters an integrated learning approach to risk management education. The learning process will take place on-line via dedicated module learning pathways. Students will be given deadlines to complete activities and to feedback by certain deadlines on Discussion Boards. Group discussoins will then take place, stimulated as and when necessary by tutor-led intervention. The programme aims to go beyond the traditional focus on subject specific knowledge and technical competence in using the tools, techniques and methodologies of Risk Management to focus on the multi-disciplinary and holistic nature of Risk Management and to ensure the development of self-critical and reflective practice skills to augment theoretical and practical competence.

Structure and Regulations:
   This programme is designed for recent graduates from a wide range of disciplines such as business, management, accounting, finance and other natural sciences who wish to develop an understanding of international banking and finance and to differentiate themselves from other candidates in the job market. It also relevant to all those professionals employed in the field of banking and/or finance who want to enhance their career prospects; as well as to all those seeking careers in the higher education and research. The aim of the programme is to balance theoretical analysis with practical application to develop a critical approach to the conceptual underpinnings of the banking and finance disciplines. To achieve this, the programme consists of eight taught modules that critically examine areas such as up to date national and international developments in banking and in financial markets; the role and functions of the banking/financial institutions and various participants; advanced concepts and theories in banking, finance and treasury management including their applied aspects; theory and pricing of financial derivatives; risk and insurance theory issues relevant to financial and banking regulation, supervision and compliance. To emphasise the holistic learning experience of the programme, the Executive Company Project or Dissertation serves as the linchpin module pulling together finance  related issues and generic skills such as critical analysis, problem solving, time management and the capacity for self managed learning. Research of top quality from within the Business School has been used to inform the curriculum to produce a distinctive programme. The philosophy that specialist research should underpin teaching is widely evident in the programme.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims


Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
The learning and teaching strategies embrace a range of approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in postgraduate business education. These include lectures, tutorials, seminars, workshops, case study analysis, collaborative group work, individual and group presentations, simulations and computer modelling.  It is expected that participants should take an active responsibility for their own learning. Participants are expected to engage in their learning environment in a meaningful and proactive manner in order to aid learning. This learning approach aims to utilise the valuable learning opportunities provided by the diversity of knowledge and experience within the cohort. The teaching philosophy is one of mutual commitment to the educational process from both the faculty and the students.  The programme uses a range of assessment opportunities such as presentations, time-constrained assessments, case study analysis and reports. The rationale for this mix is to continually develop and assess a range of skills whilst also giving students the opportunity to explore specialist topics in greater depth, partly in preparation for the dissertation or applied research project.

Structure and Regulations:
This programme is designed for recent graduates from a wide range of disciplines such as business, management, accounting, finance and other natural sciences who wish to develop an understanding of finance and banking and to differentiate themselves from other candidates in the job market. It also relevant to all those professionals employed in the fields of finance and banking who want to enhance their career prospects; as well as to all those seeking careers in higher education and research.  The programme provides students with a critical understanding of advanced concepts and theories relevant to the finance and banking disciplines including their applied aspects, their nature and significance in the modern economic environment, and the role of financial supervision and regulation as a means to reduce systemic risk and protect consumers, depositors and investors. Students are also introduced to current techniques, methods and technologies used in the finance and banking industries to measure, price, eliminate the risk associated with various financial assets, and efficiently allocate capital to the economy.  Both financial and non-financial firms are increasingly considering environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks. The reasons range from market demands and stakeholder expectations,to expanding awareness of ESG issues and the regulations designed to address them. There are also financial and non-financial benefits to prioritising sustainability. Given this context, the programme enables students to develop and apply their knowledge and skills in a socially responsible, ethical and sustainable manner to the role of a finance or banking professional as well as in other business and management-related work environments in the UK and internationally.  To emphasise the holistic learning experience of the programme, the dissertation or applied research project serves as the linchpin module pulling together finance or banking related issues and generic skills such as critical analysis, problem solving, time management, and the capacity for self-managed learning.

Entry Requirements (General):
Normal entry requirement for students enrolling on the BSc Finance and Investment degree will be 112 UCAS points from at least two A levels or equivalent (e.g. BTEC), including mathematics, statistics or physics at A or AS level, although a discount may be discretionally offered for students and consideration will be given to students with non- traditional academic backgrounds, where significant work experience may be considered as equivalent. Each application would be considered on an individual basis. For applicants whose first language is not English, an IELTS score of 6.0 overall with 5.5 in each band or equivalent is required.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
   BSc (Hons) Finance and Investment programme provides a rigorous academic approach to finance with a focus on practical perspective and employability orientation. It offers integrated theory and practice in all major finance areas and provides essential training for students to pursue a broad range of finance related professions. Students will be equipped with the most cutting-edge understanding, advanced technical skillset and professional attitudes to develop career in finance and investment professions. The discipline of Finance is explored in depth and broadened by the development of links with other co-related disciplines such as Accounting and Economics. The programme places a distinct mathematical- quantitative emphasis on the subject matter and, where appropriate, the use of commercial database and computer software, such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters Eikon, and Matlab is integrated into the teaching methods to bridge its theoretical and applied aspects. Lectures will review modern finance techniques and interpretive practices allowing students to discriminate between finance techniques and expected outcomes from a highly technical orientation. The overall course will look at different issues in finance, their theoretical and technical foundations and how these are inter-related in practice and within finance-related contexts. The programme concentrates heavily on preparing students for careers in financial sectors and related professions. The programme is structured to address many of the competence requirements of professional Finance bodies. Professional body accreditation and examination exemptions will be sought wherever possible. As Finance finds its ultimate expression in practice, the programme seeks to facilitate the development of analytical and problem-solving skills which are of value in a continuous dynamic and international environment such as that of Investment, Banking, Insurance and Pensions and Treasury Management.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
* Formal lectures and tutorials with an emphasis on giving students increasing responsibility for their own learning. * Assessment by a mixture of course work of both a formative and a summative nature and a number of traditional exams will be set. Some multiple-choice tests may be used to review progress of students, but traditional exams will predominate in part as a preparation for a future professional career. * Case work and real-life examples and/or data will be a feature of the course to allow students to adapt technical knowledge to specific scenarios and provide tailored finance advice. * Problem solving will also underpin assessment activities in line with the interprofessional nature of finance. * Group work will be encouraged throughout the course. * A sustainable and ethical context will operate throughout the majority of modules. * A significant tutorial programme will be developed to ensure that students have sufficient knowledge of the rigours of the UKHE environment and skills required for success.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
A rigorous academic approach to accounting with a concentration on the role and practices of the accounting profession and its interaction with society within the UK. Delivered with specific reference to the needs of potential accounting specialists in a highly technical manner. A use of modern information technology will underpin the course to include orientation with typical commercially available software packages. Lectures will review modern techniques and interpretive practices allowing students to discriminate between accounting techniques and expected outcomes from a highly technical orientation. At level two and particularly level three the students will be directed to a specified narrow range of modules with very limited choice and a core of fundamental accounting modules will be enforced at each level The overall course will look at both the accounting issues from both the" for-profit" and the "not-for-profit " context. Opportunities will be offered to look at the accounting issues within a rigorously technical context. The course will operate on the principle "theory into practice". There are substantial exemptions available from examinations of the ACCA and CIMA, details to be obtained from the programme leader. The course will concentrate heavily on preparing students for a career in accounting in the UK.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
       Formal lectures and tutorials with an emphasis on giving students increasing responsibility for their own learning. Assessment by a mixture of courseworks of both a formative and a summative nature and a number of traditional exams will be set. Some multiple choice tests may be used especially at level one but traditional exams will predominate in part as a preparation for a future professional career. Case work and real life examples and/or data will be a feature of the course especially at the higher levels. Problem solving will also underpin many assessment activities. Group work will be encouraged at an appropriate frequency at various levels. An IT context will operate throughout the majority of modules. A significant tutorial programme will be used to develop data handling skills. In addition to the normal accounting studies Taxation and Auditing will be a key element to level three of this course.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
A rigorous academic approach to accounting with a concentration on the role and practices of the accounting profession and its interaction with society within the UK. Delivered with specific reference to the needs of potential accounting specialists in a highly technical manner. A use of modern information technology will underpin the course to include orientation with typical commercially available software packages. Lectures will review modern techniques and interpretive practices allowing students to discriminate between accounting techniques and expected outcomes from a highly technical orientation. At level two and particularly level three the students will be directed to a specified narrow range of modules with very limited choice and a core of fundamental accounting modules will be enforced at each level The overall course will look at both the accounting issues from both the" for-profit" and the "not-for-profit " context. Opportunities will be offered to look at the accounting issues within a rigorously technical context. The course will operate on the principle "theory into practice". There are substantial exemptions available from examinations of the ACCA and CIMA, details to be obtained from the programme leader. The course will concentrate heavily on preparing students for a career in accounting in the UK.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
Formal lectures and tutorials with an emphasis on giving students increasing responsibility for their own learning.Assessment by a mixture of courseworks of both a formative and a summative nature and a number of traditional exams will be set. Some multiple choice tests may be used especially at level one but traditional exams will predominate in part as a preparation for a future professional career. Case work and real life examples and/or data will be a feature of the course especially at the higher levels. Problem solving will also underpin many assessment activities. Group work will be encouraged at an appropriate frequency at various levels. An IT context will operate throughout the majority of modules. A significant tutorial programme will be used to develop data handling skills. In addition to the normal accounting studies Taxation and Auditing will be a key element to level three of this course.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims


Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
       Formal lectures and tutorials with an emphasis on giving students increasing responsibility for their own learning. Assessment by a mixture of courseworks of both a formative and a summative nature and a number of traditional exams will be set. Some multiple choice tests may be used especially at level one but traditional exams will predominate in part as a preparation for a future professional career. Case work and real life examples and/or data will be a feature of the course especially at the higher levels. Problem solving will also underpin many assessment activities. Group work will be encouraged at an appropriate frequency at various levels. An IT context will operate throughout the majority of modules. A significant tutorial programme will be used to develop data handling skills. In addition to the normal accounting studies Taxation and Auditing will be a key element to level three of this course.

Structure and Regulations:
A rigorous academic approach to accounting with a concentration on the role and practices of the accounting profession and its interaction with society within the UK. Delivered with specific reference to the needs of potential accounting specialists in a highly technical manner. A use of modern information technology will underpin the course to include orientation with typical commercially available software packages. Lectures will review modern techniques and interpretive practices allowing students to discriminate between accounting techniques and expected outcomes from a highly technical orientation. At level two and particularly level three the students will be directed to a specified narrow range of modules with very limited choice and a core of fundamental accounting modules will be enforced at each level The overall course will look at both the accounting issues from both the" for-profit" and the "not-for-profit " context. Opportunities will be offered to look at the accounting issues within a rigorously technical context. The course will operate on the principle "theory into practice". There are substantial exemptions available from examinations of the ACCA and CIMA, details to be obtained from the programme leader.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims
    The programme is designed to provide a career entry opportunity for full-time students as well as a career development opportunity for accountants, auditors, practising managers, business consultant and, finance experts from various backgrounds, to enhance and develop their forensic accounting skills. The programme commences with an induction process, incorporating the fundamentals of forensic accounting and forensic accounting education. The induction introduces students to  appropriate skill areas, to the Programme and University. An emphasis on self-evaluation and ownership of the participants' own learning process is central to the programme and is formalised within the reflective practice element of the programme. The aim of the programme is to balance theoretical analysis with practical application to develop a critical and questioning approach to the conceptual underpinnings of forensic accounting. To this end the programme leads with core taught modules that critically examine the scope of generic fraud examination and investigation, financial crime and law, investment valuation, cybercrime and the use of internal control and audit as a tool for fraud prevention and detection. The elective modules will allow students to specialise in relevent forensic, accounting and finance topics which will permit them to consider areas of interest in more depth. To emphasise the holistic learning experience of the programme, the Dissertation serves as the linchpin module pulling together forensic accounting related issues and generic skills such as critical analysis, problem solving, time management and the capacity for self-managed learning. Research of  top quality from within the Business School has been used to inform the curriculum to produce a distinctive programme. The philosophy that specialist research should underpin teaching is widely evident in the programme.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
    Learning & Teaching: The learning and teaching methods embrace a range of approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in postgraduate management education. These include traditional lectures, tutorials, seminars, workshops, case study analysis, audio-visual presentations, guest lectures, collaborative group work, such as presentations and projects, individual presentations, simulations and computer modelling. In addituion, wide use will be made of Blackboard (the virtual learning environment) in order to encourage increased student participation and involvement. On this masters programme it is expected that participants should take a major responsibility for their own learning. Participants are expected to engage in their learning environment in a meaningful and proactive manner in order to aid  learning. This learning approach aims to utilise the valuable learning opportunities provided by the diversity of knowledge and experience within the cohort. The teaching philosophy is one of mutual commitment to the educational process from both the faculty and the students. Assessment: The aim on the programme is to strike a balance between assessment vehicles such as presentations, time constrained assessments , case analysis and reports.  Part of the rationale for this mix is to assess different skills which enable candidates to collect, prioritise, assimilate and disseminate information in different contexts.  This approach also allows the opportunity to explore specialist topics in greater depth, partly in preparation for the dissertation.

Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:


Structure and Regulations:
     The programme is designed to provide a career entry opportunity for full-time students as well as a career development opportunity for accountants, auditors, practising managers, business consultants, academics and finance experts from various backgrounds, to enhance and develop their accounting and finance skills. The programme commences with an induction process, introducing students to the programme. The induction will also introduce students to appropriate skill areas and to the University. An emphasis on self- evaluation and ownership of the participants’ own learning process is central to the programme and will be emphasised within the induction. The university central support services will also be introduced and introductory work on Excel will begin. The aim of the programme is to balance theoretical analysis with practical application to develop a critical and questioning approach to the conceptual underpinnings of accounting and finance. To this end the programme leads with core taught modules that critically examine the scope of generic accounting & finance; Contemporary Issues in International Financial Reporting, Evaluation of Management Accounting and Applied Corporate Finance. In Semester 1 students will also undertake the Research Methods module which will lay foundations for future research skills, in general, as well as for the culminating project/dissertation., specifically. The second semester is designed to progress to the Applied Trading module which will be a two-week intensive study within the Bloomberg suite where students will consider the practical aspects of investment. This will underpinned by the study of Portfolio Management throughout the semester. Students will also be prepared for future self-reflection and career development through the Knowing and Developing Yourself for Professional Success module. In addition, to these core areas student can also select an area of interest and specialism from a comprehensive list of elective modules. In order to emphasise the holistic learning experience of the programme, the Dissertation or Business Research Project serve as the linchpin module pulling together accounting and finance related issues and generic skills such as critical analysis, problem solving, time management and the capacity for self-managed learning. Research of top quality from within the Business School has been used to inform the curriculum to produce a distinctive programme. The philosophy that specialist research should underpin teaching is widely evident in the programme.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims


Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
The learning and teaching methods embrace a range of approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in postgraduate management education. These include lectures, seminars, workshops, case study analysis, audio- visual presentations, guest lectures from leading accounting experts from the industry, collaborative group work, such as presentations and projects, individual presentations, simulations and computer modelling.  The programme has a range of assessment methods such as, presentations, essay, examinations, , case analysis and reports. A wide range of assessment opportunities are used to develop students’ skills for professional employment. Students are supported to develop their skills as they work on different assessment strategies. Furthermore, part of the rationale for this mix is to assess different skills which enable students to collect, prioritise, assimilate and disseminate information underpinning forensic accounting. This approach also allows the opportunity to explore specialist topics in greater depth.  On this master’s programme it is expected that participants should take a major responsibility for their own learning. Participants are expected to engage in their learning environment in a meaningful and proactive manner in order to aid learning. This learning approach aims to utilise the valuable learning opportunities provided by the diversity of knowledge and experience within the cohort. The teaching philosophy is one of mutual commitment to the educational process from both the faculty and the students.

Structure and Regulations:
  The programme is designed to provide a career entry opportunity for graduates as well as a career development opportunity for accountants, auditors, crime investigators, practising managers, business consultant and, finance experts from various backgrounds, to enhance and develop their forensic accounting skills. The aim of the programme is to balance theoretical analysis with practical application to develop a critical and inquisitive approach to the conceptual underpinnings of forensic accounting. The programme will deal with contemporary issues in forensic accounting such as examining the scope of generic fraud examination and investigation, examining organised crime and transnational crimes in digital age, expert witnessing, governance, ethics and litigation support. To emphasise the holistic learning experience of the programme, the dissertation serves as the linchpin module pulling together forensic accounting related issues and generic skills such as critical analysis, problem solving, time management and the capacity for self-managed learning.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims


Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
The learning and teaching strategies embrace a range of approaches that have demonstrated effectiveness in postgraduate business education. These include lectures, tutorials, seminars, workshops, case study analysis, collaborative group work, individual and group presentations, simulations and computer modelling.  It is expected that participants should take an active responsibility for their own learning. Participants are expected to engage in their learning environment in a meaningful and proactive manner in order to aid learning. This learning approach aims to utilise the valuable learning opportunities provided by the diversity of knowledge and experience within the cohort. The teaching philosophy is one of mutual commitment to the educational process from both the faculty and the students.  The programme uses a range of assessment opportunities such as presentations, time-constrained assessments, case study analysis and reports. The rationale for this mix is to continually develop and assess a range of skills whilst also giving students the opportunity to explore specialist topics in greater depth, partly in preparation for the dissertation or applied research project.

Structure and Regulations:
This programme is designed for recent graduates from a wide range of disciplines such as business, management, accounting, finance and other natural sciences who wish to develop an understanding of finance and investment and to differentiate themselves from other candidates in the job market. It also relevant to all those professionals employed in the fields of finance and investment who want to enhance their career prospects; as well as to all those seeking careers in higher education and research.  The programme provides students with a critical understanding of advanced concepts and theories relevant to the finance and investment disciplines including their applied aspects, their nature and significance in the modern economic environment, and the role of financial supervision and regulation as a means to reduce systemic risk and protect consumers, depositors and investors. Students are also introduced to current techniques, methods and technologies used in the finance and investment industries to measure, price, eliminate the risk associated with various financial assets, and efficiently allocate capital to the economy.  Both financial and non-financial firms are increasingly considering environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks.  The reasons range from market demands and stakeholder expectations, to expanding awareness of ESG issues and the regulations designed to address them. There are also financial and non-financial benefits to prioritising sustainability. Given this context, the programme enables students to develop and apply their knowledge and skills in a socially responsible, ethical and sustainable manner to the role of a finance or banking professional as well as in other business and management-related work environments in the UK and internationally.  To emphasise the holistic learning experience of the programme, the dissertation or applied research project serves as the linchpin module pulling together finance or investment related issues and generic skills such as critical analysis, problem solving, time management, and the capacity for self-managed learning.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims


Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:
Using our Virtual Learning Environment, students adapt learning materials to suit their needs. Learning materials are delivered by a variety and traditional and innovative teaching methods, including lectures and guest lectures; seminars and tutorials; PC Labs and Trading Room Labs; and asynchronous support. There are  a range of assessment opportunities such as assignments, essays, exams, and projects. Some assessment opportunities will have additional support via groupwork, such as simulations and case studies; and students  have access to a personal tutor for mentoring and signposting for additional needs.

Structure and Regulations:
This programme is aimed at students looking to develop careers as accountants, finance and business analysts, managers, and academics. The programme begins by consolidating and extending knowledge of accounting and finance contexts, theories, evidence and limitations. The programme team provides additional guidance for students from business-related and professional backgrounds; and the University provides support for students with additional needs, including students from international backgrounds, and those returning to study after a break.  As students proceed, they  examine in depth,  the tools and practices of finance and accounting. They apply their knowledge in simulations, case studies, exams, essays and small research projects, developing your employability and research skills. Students  have access to our Trading Room, which provides campus and remote access to leading financial databases, statistical and other software. They also l challenge accounting and finance theories and practices by studying contemporary issues, including sustainability investing and reporting.  To complete the programme, students apply their  knowledge in either a Business Research Project or a Data Analytics Project. For the Business Research Project, students work in teams on an established case study, or on a project of their  own choosing, using qualitative or mixed methods to analyse information and challenge knowledge. For the Data Analytics Project, students  use our Trading Room and other facilities to analyse financial and accounting datasets, to validate and challenge relevant theories and models.

Programme Description: Characteristics and Aims


Learning, Teaching and Assessment Strategies:


Structure and Regulations:
            Accounting A rigorous academic approach to accounting with a concentration on both the use and the role of accounting in business and society within the UK and other major economies. Delivered with specific reference to the needs of non specialists in a limited technical manner. A use of modern information technology will underpin the course to include orientation with commercially available software packages. Lectures will review modern techniques and interpretive practices allowing students to discriminate between accounting techniques and at expected outcomes from a managerial viewpoint. At level two and particularly level three students will be able to select and pursue their own particular interests from an appropriate range of option modules including an opportunity to pursue specific interest and/or research via an accounting project. The overall course will look at accounting issues both from both the 'for profit' and the 'not for profit ' context. Opportunities will be offered to look at accounting issues from both a social responsibility and a sustainability context. Economics The aim of the programme is to provide a flexible Economics half pathway which will join with complementary subject areas, to allow students the option of tailoring their study of Economics to their own areas of interest and provide significant employment opportunities in a variety of careers. Recognition of the realisation that students are increasingly choosing to study economics jointly with another subject area is the basic rationale for the suite of Economics half pathways. The programme of study will have sound theoretical underpinning from an economic perspective and will enable students to develop proficiency in the core disciplines of macroeconomics and microeconomics and related study areas in an international context. In the first year  (level 4) all students will be required to take the core modules needed to build the foundations of knowledge for the Economics (joint) pathway programmes under consideration. Level five and six modules will progressively build learning and knowledge. At level five and six elective modules can be studied along side the core Economics modules. The elective modules are more applied in design and will allow students to study Economics in practical contexts that will enhance their employment skills. The spine of core Economics modules will deliver the key modules which feed through all 3 years of undergraduate study, namely Macroeconomics, Microeconomics. With the Economics half joining with the associated joint programme half, students will benefit from a truly cross function learning experience. The programmes allow the option of an Erasmus/study abroad year allowing an invaulable international experience.
